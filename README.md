# 🚀 Experimentation Platform for gRPC + React

A lightweight, developer-first experimentation system built for **A/B testing**, **feature gating**, and **release gating** across **React frontends** and **gRPC backends**.

Designed to **exclude beta/staging environments** from experiments and flag-based rollouts, this platform helps teams enforce environment-specific behavior while maintaining a consistent codebase.

## ✅ Key Purposes

- 🔬 Run **A/B tests** with control/treatment logic
- 🚦 Enable **feature flags** to safely gate unfinished features
- 🧪 Exclude **beta/staging environments** from production experiments
- 🛠️ Test new logic **locally behind flags** before rollout
- 🌍 **Flight features** to a small percentage of users and gradually scale up
- 📊 Measure the **impact of product or code changes** with structured experiments

## 🎯 Why Use This

- **Streamline releases** without branching or toggling manually
- **Test confidently in production** with real user exposure control
- **Reduce risk** by limiting feature exposure to specific users, segments, or environments
- **Unify feature logic** across frontend and backend via declarative configs
- Easily integrate into gRPC middleware and React interceptors

---

Built for modern engineering teams who want **safe, progressive rollouts**, this platform enables **experimentation as configuration**, not as chaos.
